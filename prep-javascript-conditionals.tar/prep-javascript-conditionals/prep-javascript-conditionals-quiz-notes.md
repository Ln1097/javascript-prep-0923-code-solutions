## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What does `strictly equal` mean?
  Strictly equal is denoted with ===. Strictly equals means that data type and the data itself must match. '5'==='5' is true, while 5==='5' is false.

- What is the logical **and** operator?
  The and operator is denoted by &&. It means both conditions(or all conditions) must be true. For example, return true if '1'==='1' && 1===1. This would be true, but if anything changes it would be false.
- Can you name some comparison operators?
  Comparison operators include less than(<), greater than(>), less than or equal to(<=), greater than or equal to(>=), strictly equal(===), loosely equal(==)
