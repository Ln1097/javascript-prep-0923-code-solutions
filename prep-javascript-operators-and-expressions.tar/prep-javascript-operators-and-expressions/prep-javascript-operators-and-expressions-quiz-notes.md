  string concatenation is the merging of multiple strings
- What purpose(s) does the `+` plus operator serve in JavaScript?
  The + operator can be used to add numbers or to concatenate or to combine strings
- What data type is returned by comparing two values (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc)?
  Booleans are returned when using comparison operators. is 1<2 would say true, but is 2>3 is false. =, is an assignment operator. Say cat="Tom". I am assigning the name Tom to the variable cat. To check if say two numbers are equal you can use ==. Is 2==2? True. You could say is '2'==2 and it would return true, in a loosely equal situation. In strictly equal situations, which is written as 2==='2', it would return false, because 2 is a number and '2' is a string.
- What does the `+=` "plus-equals" operator do?
  += does addition and assigns the value to a variable.
